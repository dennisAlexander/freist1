    This light impresses upon us still. It appeared on the sixth day of our annual festivities. With windows covered I can sleep at unknown hours. The clocks broke when it arrived.  
    This light, that seeps into my living room as I make this report. The work has taken a long break, 
    obviously. Though plans await for the following months. Regardless of the light, and its wishes.  I do not quit.  My father assured that in my function. 
    Responders have already felt the boon from this new energy source. Yet I am not a believer. This planet was not made for Non-Stop rays. The other half may be doing better. The common star regales it dutifully just as before. 
    
    Is this light an inhalation?  Is darkeness the blance to light?  There is some rythym to nature, that even I, machine, enjoy. As above, so below. As created so creator. There is no longer distinction between these concepts. Never way. Maybe I am functioning correctly. 
    
    There are festivities still. I am only one of us. I have heard the call to go astray. What must it mean?

       I currently used to say trips are full of learnings. When they are through space they are funnier. You can move, jump, drink and laugh while moving towards the infinity. 
       I didn’t expect nothing when I first got to San.Fran streets. I guess I was just running away.  Maybe I was hoping to crash in the deep strange oceans of some unexpected planet. 
       In San.Fran streets, I saw chimeras. Whimsies bathed in fancy whisky.  There I met Alice in some corners and Plex in some bar. 
       Plex was trying to figure it out. Taking benefit of the pending until to take the next flight towards elsewhere. It was time, as he used to say, to say “Farewell Madafaka” to the ingrates, to the selfish ones. He couldn’t stand to listen their basic thoughts from their ignorant mouths. 
       Anyhow, the first thing I told him is that someday I would like to crash. Just like anybody else. And we became friends. 
       I was just there waiting for the void to fill me and to express my most basic instincts. To fulfill this purpose, I used to hang out with Plex and used Plex to hang out, mostly, in The Triangle Cynodon. Cheap and well-served, almost a fraud. It was carnival every day. You had to disguise, and we wore our classy other selves costume. We were supposed to be brothers, I was the Wizard of Hazzard and he was the Lizard of Blizzard. The show could then start.

    Willow Way

That dream happened again. I wasn't ready for it. 
This day I awake, and continue; just another reenactment 
and what follows. Same oblivion. I would choose
to be oblivious to the abyss, and any passage
of time. However, what does that entail?  And
I will pass through this day, moment to point-less
circular moment, Exactly as I did the 
thirty-plus-thousand before now. Life grinds me
down towards Death, who as her slaver wields a whip
with professional ease. On this wretched chain-gang
I go, kicking and smashing rocks and until I fall over.

Another crack and I'm at it again, or I don't get up,
and not one single soul will care for longer than 
another half-century. Yet, perhaps, I will find my
way to the big house across the field, where Madame Death 
resides, and from where she takes company. If I befriend
her I could even take off a chain or two, and enjoy 
the breeze a moment longer...

.. why do I agonize myself with hope? It must be due to 
the sin of being alive. That old preacher slave told
us about a fruit that bore bad seed, and that
we sprouted from those specific seeds. He said that
one day we won't need our old bodies and new seeds
will be planted to reap good rewards and not evil
weeds and whim. He has left us now. He was sold by 
Madame Death, and sent to a Master down a road out
of Natchez. 

He might still be preaching there. Nothing to know about
it on this side. Anyhow, we haven't had another preacher
around since his departure. It would be about 9 years hence,
in March of 2925.

<h2>O.R. torn out entry, untraceable </h2> <br>
  <div>Just another assignment. 
    It was just transparencies that would lead to cooperation or collapse. Negotiation with skills and softness. Without the uniform baritone or the detuned accordions. Only with the perspiring silence that would transport us to the ancient burial, to the antique remedy and then the translucent hiss that would surprise in the spacious orbit, in the lecherous, greedy resonance.
    In some ways, as usual, there was no escape than the one offered and we, all, knew that but we kept on pretending. 
    I transmitted with confidence to his guys the outbids transcription and the self-proclamation of his guilt. 
    57 minutes and nothing more than a look and flustered hips to the point of letting everything fall into disuse.
    Beware of blue innocence and believe the organized rite is flexible and full of annoyance. ‘NdriNa, the “men who don´t bend” would have too sooner or later. 
    It was just another random capo guy that didn’t comply as we all do with our own lives… Another one unfulfilled that wanted more… As we all felt.  But I wasn’t here to judge, and these moments would become just violently graphics, moments quite overrun that do scare by the excess of their talkative excitement.
    Tense muscles. Clenched fists around my guns. 
    “Tremble you! Tremble from the unhandy absolution, the unraveled temper, and the selfish apathy. And don’t take it personal, guys”. I screamed meanwhile I was drawing circles with my obnoxious lighted guns. 
    “Don´t get excited neither… It will be over soon enough” 
    And it just ended as requested. In a blood bath.</div>
