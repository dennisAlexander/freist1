    P.D 321 Subversive submergence

And we drove towards the Norris highland. Parallel dimension 19.

“That is difficult to suppress this will, bitter soul”

 In the symbology of me, I'd been poor, and we, all, might had been once, one way or another. I couldn’t respond. Faced with social specters, progress and overcoming was what we should be doing and what was the example. It couldn’t be. I had to step in. To step in. Two year. Two fucking years. And I didn't care know how right he could be. It had been ordered. A narrow universe is a piece of glass fragmented by so much apprehension. 
It seemed unlikely we could go back. They told me like about the South, how they went to Hawkinsville Universe then. About the Yeah, yeah, yeahs, the heads and hips saking, the right-thumbers up in the air, and how they throwed away what was coming by and rather focus on music capture. 

“For the Lords have done so much and so few in an incredible existential knot”. 

The suburbs out of Norris, in the hills under the Californian Camelot, always fed my hunger for subversive thoughts. We all wanted to feel, in the turquoise air, to be entire, to annihilate these prejudices and frustrations. Free spirits challenging and thrashing. Each word-command made us want to climb bridges and jump. Because we had inability to really accept this sub-reality or to handle the deficiency of purpose. “Purpose was overrated” anyways (Thanks Ness). We tried to be interested to the material and to find it iridescent. 

“…as five dollar, please sir, listen… Please, listen. My mind is strange and doesn’t do so well right now. Tell me how far I went, tell me I reached to earn something here and hand it to me. I’ll be thankful.”

Nobody lived off the call. We all gave up. A sunset like a sunk one. Here, they turned down the sky. Plain night, scarce bonfires, ashes rising and falling on the dirty souls. Everyone was there singing around the fires pretending to be amused, drowning dim sensitivities in the smoke. 

“Hand it to me all right.” 

You could hear the echoes of sad laughers all over the embracement of a lost community. Here, you felt like part a family. Of failure, of unfitness. You could see the flames reflecting in the discouraged glances. Here, we were erased once for all, heading towards the elapsed ones finding what happened when you encounter the oblivious peace in the night.
We were just expecting to fall in the glitch and to disappear altogether fading in the ethereal chain dance and the distorted yodels.   
I guess we were all right.

Hurricane winds blow across the sun baked south. It is not deserted here. There are trees, and women, and men, working or dining, loving or fighting. A rainbow will surely frown across the sky, yet once the hobo stands atop his weathered head, he will see, a smile.
There are many travelers lately, all escaping, all divided, all full of hope and fear. That great american hwy has broughten them here and will take them away. No description. Only stillness of acts played out across a stage; transportation causeways and freeways, asphalt always.  They must have paid more than a few tolls to get here. And now, there are none. Here, freedom reigns in blatant poverty. Oh how free it is to have no options. God’s teeth gleam and little Johnny feels-up Hannah’s breasts. A kid rides a stolen bike. A pa goes with out, yet keeps on grinning through the smoke of his tobac.

Nothing like the sun and ocean and roaring where water dances in the air. It does not arrive this time. Only saftey, and the passingby of millions, most of whom simply wait to go back.
Refuge from the storm that does not cease is something else...
though for now, and here, the winds blow well and fine.

It is hidden, we are not meaningless, we as organism, fruit and fornication and food, and filth, and flagellation. Hold down the face of it, and tears and blood congeal and wander out onto stretch floor laughing. Great enemies lost, and nothing ever learned.
The humm and burn is needed, but only lightly, and more later.

Something was not right. There could have been another summer.
The season turned and what was it that was forgotten?

Object to it, only to be, everything. Therfore, know now, that nightly that emptiness is free.  This cup is whole, complete, yet empty. This skull, this open palm, etc.  Feel unimpeded and careless, and write less. Prose, if it is bad, will let the principle go. So here goes nothing before dusk, yet how worse a limited day.

The gentle hum, unceasing drum of an a/c unit, drowns out the noise and lets us sleep or remain alert and vigilant of dark and lamp lit scenes.  How many crisis must be beyond us now?  Let spirits embark and find the life of wisdom and wine drunkenness.   A dream; it could have been, but what does it matter?  A dream lived is godly.

It is not infinite in proportion to other things. If there is an “infinite” there can be no finite things.  

I am a union worker from the fifth star system, of the celestial cluster known as Älçesi 9.  I have no name, but an AlphaNumeric definer. This has been the organization principle since New Europa (the planet, not the republic) colonized this piece of ‘'outer space’' as the rose lipped journalists call it.  My definer is 1h3eiuhd3, though my slot companion calls me Unash.  I recall once that my mother spoke to me in another tongue, before she was sent to N.E. for her own betterment.  ‘'It is all for the betterment of the Älçesi’' is what they used to say. Though now they don't say that anymore. They hardly are ever seen.  My information comes from dailies which escape the boilers somehow. The emperor did this, and the production does that.  

The union is not trusted, though it is mandatory inscription and that’s that. I saw how 2809h22f ended pefectly ugly, and .. excecuted..

O:R 6 Infinte pouring 

Light pours out of everywhere,
Flashing and hurled into it.

Only electrical destiny
is ours to form, and repeat,

Only energetic animals
are we, through desire and defeat,

Darkness gains velocity, curled
back fingers, a pretty weave

Pa opens the door, going fishing
net line bait, enough to leave,

The sun quakes and boats return,
water shakes in bright twirls.

I am not sure if I have ever written before or have ever desired it. Life is better not lived if there is not even imagined will.
They let us write here. At least I assume so. There is paper in this machine, and I press the lettered keys which produce script, thus constructing a page of content.  I remember how. My name, or place or situation, _ I do not.  It is cold here, and all that is heard is hum and rushing air. A soundless and caged fan whirls above me, displacing the little light let in to this cell. Cell?  I think it means a small room.  The purpose is not clear. Yet, if I am in one, the steel door is shut from the outside. There is no lever or handle on the inside, here where I am.  

My name. I do not know. I found myself in this chair. The room utterly barren if not for it, my body, and this writing machine set infront of meonto a ledge of the high ceiling wall.  The floor must only span 3 by 5 meters. The walls are over 8 meters high. I look for the cobwebs though cannot see the top corners clearly. I am not hungry.  There is not a belly on me, though I am not thin. Maybe I am new to all this. I do not remember anything except the dream. It was of playing ball with a child, and eating icecream afterward. It is a sugary and cold treat. And it uses cream though I forget what that is, yet do know the adjective ‘creamy’.  That scene faded quickly and I was before a building smoking a cigarette speaking to  a man about ‘pricing’.  I was interuppted by a ringing in my pocket, and stuck a rectangular computer to my ear, a voice asked if what I would like for dinner, and then said that it ‘i love you’.  

The dream. That is past, and my only memory so far. I am starting to suspect it changed every-time I reimagine it. I have written it on the walls, though the lines blur.  At least I have a blanket and underwear. I am sleepy again, though how can that be?  A corner looks inviting.  Maybe just an hour or two, and I might awake and know who I am.

It has been days, weeks, a forever that turns quickly in an all night drive, then the sun breaks and the body turns to ash. I have learned to laugh again, and no longer need a reason. Fuck reasons.

It is better to wait out the storm, enjoy the sun shine, pack up and leave. I hear nothing from the other side. I only talk to myself. I only write to myself. This. Communication. Is. One. Sided.

A tiny fly hopes to sip from my glass of wine. She darts and sits at my eye lid. A fly must not ever be bored.

Boredom is a human and dog trait; a feature of mammalian life forms. Does the arachnid get bored in an endless stream of survival?  If one were perpetually at sea, a drift, though alive by catching fish, and drinking rain, would he be bored? Yes.

That is the game. The gentle ruse that makes us all losers on the genetic map. The world is a gene’s world.  

The system of achievement and failure is utter hell, invented by us schemers to revel and suffer while we quickly burn away.  Do not feel the electricity asking if you are light; only adjust the gaze
and continue to wander down the street, stopping at the next corner. Or not. </div>

I do not know my self. Though I do know that I am. There are
roaches, tiny ones, mostly in the kitchen or on the wall.
This is ok. I accept it. I only have a cup, a bowl of sorts,
and three utensils. Also, there is a bottle opener. And now
I remember I am drinking wine, so I have a glass as well.
A receptacle standing on a long stem connected to a flared
base. Wine glass is it’s name. The wine tastes like vinegar.
It is a cheap wine, and I am ok with that. I am cheap.
I have few dreams. One of them is to sail on a ship. Another
is to get a poem published in a pretty magazine that is
distributed in the boutiques and shops of New York. A third
one is to die dreaming. That cannot be explained. However,
let it be known that I shall be administered a substance.
I wash my dishes before use; every, time.  

The missionary
is visiting again tonight. He will arrive at about 1 am.
He is driving to Oklahoma tomorrow. That is according to his
message. I will remain here. As always. I have coding to
understand. An exam attempt. A schedule to follow.

A motorcycle is necessary now. Harry, the mechanic, effectively destroyed the car I was using. I enjoyed that car. I listened to new future funk mixes, and it rid low, and felt well to be there on the road, transported like that.   It will be difficult finding a cycle for a decent price.  I have distaste for my own country. Yet the wind blows like anywhere else.

This report may seem like journaling. It is not. It is a simple fiction, osea.. all facts must be lies in a way for them to hold truth. All glass must be flexible matter before it can be rendered.   It is not important if I am understood. 
That I know that I am is sufficient.

The day is barely seen before it is forgotten.
Not this day, not the slow lag of an image
loading into the field of vision. Dawn is what
is the day. A shimmer and shine is only after-
affect. Only dance. This star’s gentle curve,
that is in fact stillness, is eternity.

Master and disciple. This is the human way.
Winter is unfounded. It is only an absence
of heat. Death is not. Life is. Moving still.

The only possible response is laughter.  
A friend may leave,
a lover may become disgusted
and leave as well.  Do not forget. Smile.

Portal and initiate. This is an opening
that let’s the world inside. A hum is
always heard; an atmosphere beams
with a chaotic rhythm

only thanks to a rising orb, at times
called a son of him without name,
yet he has a name and she knows.
Remember. Come Alive.

Easy then, wind blows,
water crashes, and
fire is always
the frame,

we are her victims,
as we are
the game.

Same old day, which is not day. It is artificial light.
Though the canteen worker said ‘’have a good day’’ we
knew, operator Lacret and I, as we went on exiting,
eager for better things and more work, and how’s you do it’s,
that it is not day, at least on Cetron. It is really night.
That in fact no longer matters. The great emptiness has us,
and we are not touching ground any time soon.

A good schedule meets a good reward. That phrase they
print above the pith dispensers. The bell rings, and we
take the substance. That is why we can be happy. No
work goes unrewarded. Even bad work has its reward.
Usually a bad worker is sent to another sector, where
he can train in other skills, more suited to his
aptitude.  He is never missed; his departure is good.

Pevca started vomiting blood. Twice now and counting.
Once after first meal, and again after second meal.
He won’t talk to us, since we are not superiors as
he is. Lacret says it must be the way he chews.
I think he’s an addict of the stuff, though you
can never be sure. The superiors can obtain it easier (than us lowlies),
and have access to the instruments
necessary for subdermal appplication of the salve.

Another technician passed just now, and rubbed
one palm against Pevca’s baldness. In the palm of
his other hand what was enclosed?   You can’t know
for sure, though everytime it opens, more emptiness
follows, and the lights recede.  





We are just new robots working in a too simetrical society. I was learning about bullshit jobs today and i felt we are onto something. 

You see, I am a firm disbeliever in free will.  There are billions of organisms that make up this sensual sheath considered to be us. Us, another organism, part of other systems, which are part of other systems. This is basic. Childish deep imaginings. Though I am not finished!  It we purport to be body and soul, this self and creed, - How can we continue our atomic philosophies, and greedy self morals? “ Everything is just an atom, and its parts, all the way down, never ending. Understood?  “  Thats the idea of the genetic lottery, and invisible hand that deals the cards. We are supposed to be the players in that scenario. When we are merely played... 

I will talk to command and  for 6 days will send appropriate reports from current space expeditions that are being conducted by the company.  I hope this will fulfill your needs. The organization is vast so I must choose from thousands of daily reports for numerous agents in contracted corporations such as yours.  Faithfully in contact, N.

DS has not maintained contact since it passed unknown sint sector. If you have any communique from that ship, contact your superiors or have drones do it. I am in the fitness Bay, OR will be sent 36:25 thearian time.
