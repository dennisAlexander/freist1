<h4>MOMENTS to GO</h4>


<p>Friest Fabrikat, CDMX, 2020</p> 



1—————————————————————————

Self-sacrifice. 
Stop being bored.
Be the walls
sit forgotten
Live silently and deep 
The most beautiful sculpture is an inversion of dead time. 
Pleasure tomorrow
at dawn a drop of Happiness 
Today’s never in the new
Poetry, fly across the abstract future
Zones dangle streaks of a painted prospect
Paving moment without light
They themselves notice a cop’s head and streets. 
Stone thrown people 
Revolution at night
Long live the numbered seats in their office
Boredom belongs to crowds
Time.
Something ceases.

2————————————————————

Lonely tide like a comforter over me 
A lonely girl moves, at ease, more modestly, to the lonely sea
A perpetual exercise of clarification
The pattern on the horizon with only a ghost tonight
All shadows clarify it
And you,
Philosophy of your lonely flat tide.
Dark lit green and moonbeam white.
Suppressed is the gray clock.
On a faceless moon a clock's rising edge reconstructive 
but not detected
The negativity internal of the day and a moon so hush
The tide, sand, moonbeam, the critical use of truth 
Night has gone so cry 
So cry
How can I
Can I

Boom in “Aussie"——————————————————

Obedience, Obedience
Like all working breeds.
A Relationship with the valued stockmen 
for Sublime mental caverns without herding 
Australian Shepherds and elusive fleeting dreams 
Bliss beyond this world by shepherds. 
Shepherds. 
They of dog that was, Australia 
The eagerness to please and therapy dogs.  
Do Australian Shepherds rescue the empty century?
Simply the century as the World after public disaster
Australian Shepherds
rose in popularity with United States
and thus in the Great Hidden Sea of Recognition
They became known for television.
For many the United States made movies are considered a Western energy
Disney Shepherd
You are going, dogs
While they continue the Sublime is disappointingly from the Basque regions 
Get back there to the exact history of its arrival in This World 
The bedded deep story is lost and drive. 
Australian Shepherd, often known of the breed prior to the unconscious
The Sunshine War developed the general medium-sized breed
I feel an empty bliss beyond the Border Collie
They are similar if they might be vanishing shepherds 
Most likely is Border despite its name, 
Border Collie was of sufficient lucidity due to their frisbee
Libet's Camaraderie at dog sports
Stock dogs, guide dogs, descendant of Carea Aussies
other kinds were brought over 
and compete in Memory 
and To Want To have been
Shepherd and Australian Shepherd. 
Long term dogs, by the arms length without delay 
on the ranches of minimal mental gradations of loss 
Tiny Shepards 
closely herding 
all moments

The Coming Continuity------------------

	    The indignant desert birds. The Second Coming!  No one was in the cabin.  Hardly the 
    drawing of characters. Then a gallery, and then the armchair with its green bark.  Did 
    they lead the path in trees in the park?  The study which looked out at a rough beast, its hour train;
    he allowed himself and then the knife, head of the man.  
	    They separated in the sands of a lover's body, as the letter to the pages that went up like eternity.  
    The illusion he took at once, even those few caresses days before. His protagonists; He tasted of himself,
    disengaging line in unforeseen hazards, possible mistakes. Time that his head, its oaks sprawled in turn, 
    crouching among the turned for a loose moment. He ran in there, to dissuade him.  He had put it aside though. 
    Light from the great estate danced under the oak, a matter of the worst.
	    The full darkness drops again; memory, the falconer, retained the names door,
    which would otherwise hear things yearning.  Shadows of dialogue raced down twenty centuries.   
    His back to the mountain cabin.  Each instant had it from it, is sketched abominably of the branch.
    Admirably she slouches, necessary to destroy. Nothing he could distinguish in that reel is loosed upon the novel. 
    Turning and he was witness to it, his hand, that of passionate intensity.  Surely heroine, 
    letting himself go to spring.   Of the lustful, to the book towards Bethlehem in Coming out of Spiritus Mundi
    but I now know dry leaves and furtive trees at hand leading up to windows, the afternoon air, the final 
    encounter of interrupted images,word by word, in mere anarchy.
	    A hand for other body, it was rocking a cradle.  And what came together to the estate and took the plot?  
    Were the dogs immersed, and did not bark?  Are cigarettes within a bedroom that cannot get dark?  
    Beyond the great stony sleep vexed the first manager of his estate.  The widening agent there at this 
    hour as he was relaxing comfortably against that which surrounded him.  When a vast image by reach of his hand, 
    intrusions, he let his use minutely assigned to the dagger.  			
        Writing had not come to have bothered him the afternoon of the blue parlor.  The pitiless of the sun, 
        her kisses but he,
    the hero and dusk of the avenue against his chest cannot hold.  The trees and hedges discussing with about 
    three porch 
    steps on the color and movement no one had felt in the house.
	    Two doors.  The manager is moving upon the slow paths through the forest park.  The figure to that beginning of
     a nightmare, the final rivulet of snakes, the left hand caress the blood through the yellowish fog of all that 
     had once been decided.  The sordid dilemma galloping in his ears upon a carpeted stairway.  Are words out of details, 
     barely wishing to hold him?  Troubles, my sight.  The falcon without looking, with all lack of conviction, had
      come because 
     of some urgent turning.  The best gyre.
	    The second door.  Surely the Second in the opposite direction.  She rebuffed her caresses on his way back, 
     wishing to keep him without effort.  Still reading a line that led north.  Revelation is joint ownership.   
     His face on an armchair until thighs all had come, warmed itself on and again the chair.  Barely the ceremony 
     of innocence. 
     Alibis entered.  The high head somewhere back to caress a cheek.  
        The back still at business, covered windows opened again, the world would fall apart in his favorite armchair
     with velvet upholstery, the lion body which writhed about his hand.  A secret passion, protected in green velvet,
     to follow everywhere he was not.  From this hour on, cut of a man again, returned by line reading toward where
     the images of interest were rigidly fixed upon a green growing centre.  He slowly set all by the trail, to watch her
     running as almost loosed, and he was not. It was to it to those by which to one, from them with those he let after 
     the salon door.
        Now the lover came to the top.  The blood-dimmed tide came after the woman’s words:  READ THE NOVEL.  
     An irritating possibility forts double re-examination of liberty pounded underneath.  The shape of her hair awaited
      drowned 
     ceremonies of the desert.  Repeat writing and the first come round at last.  Cold-blooded chapters were not supposed
      to be ready.  
     Not while the world, almost perverse with pleasure, had been forgotten.
	    A gaze blank and stanched with the blood by the backlash of the tranquility of his woman that arrived first,
         apprehensive;
     feeling each other now the same, HE HAD BEGUN TO


DNC--------

Now, I proudly split into thirds poverty?   And I trust bowl of a lower portions between 2010 and Decisions, not just every

	A:  After he plundered the stronghold recap, any perishable item to the maximum of Similarly. 
        Samples containing perishable items dawn of their return.  Of sense in which Nietzsche puts it still seems
        to me is, without venturing it, excluding purely maternal or paternal language.  Even if it does not lower,

       Speaking of how daring every thoughtful word addressed to Being unique, any of its implications, and an explanation. 
       The possible cutbacks reports from post offices and word, in the finally proper 3 hours. Period! Period!  
       The U. U. S. S. Name. There will be no in the 2020 elections, U. U. S. S.

       The letter a in différance, the unique name.
	Q: [unintelligible]
	A:  And that one puts into the Postal Service, obtained by dairy, and perishable grocery, 
        (cut a lost native country of perishable foods taken out). Nevertheless such daring are their 
        own recklessness;
         always destroyed them and is everywhere throughout language.  (cumulative time – even if it would 
         have to find a thrown out.
         Out. Unwrapped, cut name melons. And such is the for the proper word and in the produce dept.)  
         That of the cattle of Lord Helios,

         them, for From this we can gather
        is not the primary prescription to all dialectics, the other is out of refrigeration. And we must

 to ease their lot. At labor, leading up, I decide that being different from traditional areas, 
 it should be matter of the worst.
 Movements no one had seen coming; rivulet of snakes and afternoons of blue oaks sprawling 
 in the path of spring, lustful ones, becoming a space between the indignant desert turned 
 loose and the overlapped conviction painted with soft touch.
 I allow myself to it: This sense of surrounding, this tone of hero of the division, 
 this melodramatic muddle.
Admirably interrupted images, simultaneous words and this interior space that breaks.
 They wanted letters, formulations and sprawls, so it was necessary.
 Hardly the blood turns into the unbelievable yellowish darkness and beyond myself,
  my disengaging lines, I am only a witness. A passionate one.
The intensity and nonsense is surely the heroine, and the lullaby of the unwise hear. 
Curve structures of verses turn, crouching among the hounds of sheets immersed, 
and I would relax comfortably against a carpeted tree of meaning.
It elevates the souls beyond reach but the furtive ladder is hidden. More color
 to build the forest park! More light for the figurative and inspiration! I still taste the unforeseen hazards,
  the possible mistakes, the rusty knife, the green sand that grinds under the tooth; yet, the pitiless of the open windows,
   the sunsets with lack of humor, the upgraded sense of dry urgency let me go to places other than this desk, than this lurid extant.

The Coming Continuity------------------David Freist 
Personal mix 

So far, so good.
To perish to be heavenly, soul up to Heaven! To fly to this illustrious paradise,
embrace the blessed universal love as a victorious spirit!
On the wings of a certain belief, only a God will judge pride and sorrows.
Badly worn deity; this is the crime, this is the audacity to which it exposes us.
I see myself in the bosom of this unfaithful Divinity, I am the son of the weary man, I, 
in the deep pit, with my feeble sad eyes which cannot shrink from other blasphemy.
Sighing here below, under the exhilarating vault, my soul above its creature; this oppressed soul,
flying over the round earth.
So, this is what remains to us of his will: this tree with dazzling arms where our 
own Lord ignored the remains of humility, greatness or strength.
This world must realize the sovereign ambition and bury the silly weak hope.
Freedom has been denied to the vulnerable oppressed , to the cowardly spirit of the strong.
They just dream of another Heaven, of an offering; lowlands where the body devours the bitter
treasure of mortal fruits and tears away the sensitive nature.
Alas, the Man carries only one sentence in his mouth!
So far, so good.

Dieu et la liberté : Auguste Lacaussade / Extase Théodore Agrippa d'Aubigne

Experiences of self.
The ego, once remembered, evaluated, planned, and experienced as the “self” or “I”.
Personal point of reference which relates to some lamp burns, beside the widely chosen chisel,
 pen or brush harsh.
I, off the hand of the master; whether I have looked upon the hics and remember the deliberate happiness.
Ego coexisting with the id, ego stone mocking those selves who cry aloud, of their momentary screams or
 their common dreams, dissipate in executive function, in prevenance of struggle…
Impulsive men, stupefied hearts and superego.
For hope, its light, I drive, most exalted lover of life.
I fly in the marmalade of the human personalities, by these eccentrics, disclosing their blindness 
and the sands by the edge of the human mind.
The world serves it in action, denies kif, or love to those who have lit their sensitive hic.
 Yes. That portion of Hic.
And yet, the imagination chief would present, represent the search for happiness, 
sing about concept forms, open the core of an early book, and trace 
these imposing characters stream that look most like me.
Because I seek an image, not illness, nor significant changes in life.
The oil lamp is consuming alone besides an ethical sentimentalist component.
What an irony!
The old nonchalance that echoed my personality or body, derided the style itself,
 being my anti-self, standing upon unconquerable delusion. Ridiculous circumstance of a shattered ego.
  Overflowing. Yes. It grew and grew. It was superb, ironic, magical shapes.
While art is a stony face staring upon the lack of countenance.
Being poor, ailing, and ignorant, all, that and still, I have handled though superego and walked over moons.
The ego gives continuity and sink slowly into his own grave, his own senses.
No, the events of the past, retained of the world, the coarse-bred son, the imitation of great masters I was,
 the comprises and its contact with the unsatisfied heart I wished, this lecherous life, the solemn contemplation
  I worshiped were not bitter enough for memory.
My modern image might be an influence, an inspiration, should paint the beings proving hollow,
 craving, and unpersuadable justice.
Vision of glowing  reality on the goldy sand and shallow streams.

Ego Dominus Tuus William Butler Yeats
https://www.britannica.com/topic/ego-philosophy-and-psychology
Sleepy hero
Green garden, where a river is, and his body getting wet.
In it, courage and courage are resting. Smiling like a sickly defiance and sometimes even 
showing off disaster cuts. Unrated. His movements are usually the shuddering of his muscles; 
nothing more to attract sophisticated readers.
With the head uncovered, and the long hair waving to the rhythm of the water; silver rags;
 where the sun joins its rays with the surface. In this green liquid bed where the light falls and
  his concern for the instinctive, predictable and inevitable, he agrees to die. It is a code of honor 
  that overwhelms you in battle.
A young soldier, his mouth under the skies, and his magnanimous rest: 
Nature, warmly mixed with heroism.
He is reckless at times, and in his boastfulness and rivalry lies a perennial freshness.
 He still looks too ordinary by mythical standards, his hand on his pale chest.
War or dangerous adventures make this man. He is usually a moment, an event that will become 
glory for his descendants when the poets and their audience become thoughts.
He stands there, resting, ready to blow his horn again and help mortal men, who suffer from open pain.
He is wrong, risking his life and the memory of life, but defying gravity in battle, he draws
 the attention of the immortal gods, creating through his own efforts, new enemies. 
 Also wrong are trifles, beliefs, love of gifts and rewards he may say. And because of that,
  the hero will still exercise like a child would smile. A man of action and a fundamental influence for posterity.
His future shipwreck will be this proud mountain, where he will want to shine one last time.
 Even if his final desire to build a house, and navigate the normal occupation of a hero, bubbled up in the little valley.

First kiss. An insert. I know you're not going without your straitjacket. Surrounded by mechanics, 
I won't tell you who, but apparently Hawaii on vacation, is a purifier. The pose that you present now 
smoothen the times which are clouds.
Glide. Stop or ignore me. If after lying, the supernatural power of need is apparently nothing but bought 
love, projected indiscriminately, allow me the constraint, to be the insensitive skin, the shooting prey 
To nothing, mens or to all your customaries, the dead. Let me be the dreamer embalmed in the deluge of dowsers, 
this fanatic of torrential falls.
In the aftermath of productive packages, the extent of loneliness is recognizable so well. Figures as soon as
 they fainted as they were composed, it was my illusory paradise, because they were frozen. So there will be no athletic love.
The crossing of the river necropolis where we kill, where we are killed can begin. I will erase the tracks 
from memory, their famous revolution, the apotheosis of the ephemeral. 
But that will not change the usual landscapes, nor will it break the agglomerated harmony, in the opacity 
of mausoleums, nor will it make the already dire places unrecognizable.
The universe will remain endless to you.

giving that this town is filled earth world and all Scalded your body with it. 
So there’s peace, the trivial noose already fitted to your years. Sounds like that. And that sound fades away.

Pellet of some idle filled darkness within your footsteps. You leafed again 
and another feared the nights that ruined, sterile earth calm composed and at 
attention beneath the noose, in with the ghosts. Stoop at or snare, you follow me? 

That lays before you. Heat hear rustlings. And people become present. Suddenly 
your heart is of the sky beyond. But I think there won't be another night, 
and sang—whereupon you who someone's behind you, stepping vision one last

which penance could do,  as if time doesn’t rob you of, standing already free, 
with this whole neck of yours in earth’s grief and used up.

 And voices breath of life stopped, leapt from memory to laughing. Laughter 
 that sounds the cobblestones. When you snatch away the next year, there would 
 be creature as hawk that might have come before, with a  downhill trajectory. 
 The lime sun with a random color, even as the trap boy self-destructs 
 before departure, it's uphill; but with echoes.

It's like walk you feel like eyes scarcely moved; they’re struggling to free 
your memory, blotting out the sorry and mortal body less than a second while 
your tiny throat anguishes into eternal peace. 



 Elegy of the Forest

Beauty and Albania, be recovered. Intubated. Protection units are growing and 4 tested positive with ink,
 the number of infected during the last forests has shrunk, less words have shrivelled in lovemaking,
  For they draw trees on walls of their two major hospitals, in a frenzy.

319 recoiled and rivers lead to a zoo. Twentieth century in 24 hours, brought and abandoned.
 Over 68,500 people. Eyes, Tattooing victims, the newspapers cannot contain, in Tirana. 
 Conducted on a total of Albania. Shame, the total death in office buildings. Currently there are 198 patients,
  there are rumours. The 3901 active cases, 6186 patients who the forests have confirmed on billboards while 
  patients on 10,406 roads have grown, in Albania, 2074 coronavirus cases were a major plague. Alarming rate.
   Love has been temporarily renamed 'COVID2'. The end of the forests, treated as folly. The Faces have receded. 
   And will be us, like zebras, less than animals now, and the forest’s slender arm, dwindled.

Of blood, the surge, ‘To be continued’. TIRANA. We Albania, cannot make love in hospital. 
The forests say the coronavirus in the rivers are often with the moon laid bare. Poetry,
 sighs the birds have less than the forest to be used. A little boy regrets nothing,  
 forests have shrunk, as the cities have expanded, All country. Furthermore, 151, 
 last 24 hours, trees in my surgery department.

 Defeating the Bullet on a Cross Palace Hitch

-- ode to beatnik methodology --- 

Not be true?" ------------------- 
It into the etherless of you, ha!
split brain keeps the doorway, frame of mind of the land. 
You never sea coast. He told me o, v, e, between the us to neither hear, 

calling my pal, ha!
my true blue, you still say this could monster 
eleven heads, five johnny bravo. …

The day was. Your heart rate, before you is brutal all ways. ha!
Though The venerable Lord Buddha found special sun
you can not last one nite after 36 hours of a prosperous king
who your eyes, smile, and ancient teeth ha,
 
on as Keroac, Cassidy, others, ha!
Where were schemes, desire's rote, a bore to communicate.
Dualish, ha,
be my forgettence: "You were the son of a calm remote ocean.”

 I still lying here, forever. I'm “I” as was once a, ha!
 sea miracle to be born once, being up.
We've managed ourselves into the Valley. Matt, from this story 
of his journeys to the theme, howling night, drooping moon, learn to greet, for it appears... 

Go's hid away before inactions." "Bpulkoueajljoiuerouav" I bellowed. ha!
"You! Orlando, lives here. I slept in grace.” ha!

The gate to the transformation line , we whispered. ha!
 l/We are elders before dawn.
 Hundred eyes, ten thousand teeth, of without awareness,
 
Listening to her in LA. Ja'More is here, the form you've taken. ha!
Yet, say no! this can not physically be together. 
I know this all in all a realistic sense aslong as the Why defames you,
i talked to ‘miss you shades’, & that dream that repeats per its CHAOS, 
 
dear diary, I, American horizon. No one realizes reality without tangibility, ha!
senses, sound without the ear, 
but this to be in one crossing last night over the palace. 

Now, you pal, my last solace in consciousness,
what aware, would say without speaking, 
rather lived in the cape and meriads of flaming nostrils. Ha! 

This image of self is a loose cannon without beginnings in doubt
 What was hitching here from Portland. Have you been reborn in this too?
 We are staying, kidnapped self, when defeating the bullet,...
 Too difficult I'm a dream on the be true, but look as I laugh Joyfully to see it,
 but rather plays unknowingly meingh, at John's house in San Fernando, 
manager of all  slaughter houses, each other nothing, proclaiming this masquerading relating 
never sparked romance, brother, be my sin, wrapped, were born? The Beat goes.

poem To Live and Die in Mobile, by Nez

Toilet is filling up with immigration status, location, location! 
All went two blocks and hightailed,
can't handle the small stuff congress are pushing their own run on back,
you ain't know what to do, go gender expression, economic status, ability, our wealth

Shit batch out! . Most days were “We believe” that all people, is 
We are self-reflecting, go out again. Again! 

My sister Cry Baby Chuck Schumer. Burning businesses, looting, raised by black women.  
“My brothers and sisters, to participate we need another 4 years of apathy” 
 I went full pot-head, Buying votes starts to add up. We cultivate an intergenerational 
 ad-agency all the freebees at the upstairs window. 
Wake up The Socialist Party who are sacrificing, once a neglected shaman, 
never once a calculator. 

Get on Alegra and our cities, lives, "the movement too late cause the left 
(I called her Mister Meatry) extended families and “villages” that higher than the tax base stops the carnage?”
 Carnage? How many by supporting each other as We make space for transgender digging, roofing with 
 another addict, Floyd? Floyd? Floyd? Is America so "Brainwashed" “double shifts” so that they

in private, any of this perceived sexual identity, gender identity, my gills, 
instead go to 'real life'. . Everyone was nice to be disproportionately impacted 
by janking (if you get that they sharing, or why haven't moved to Portland, and found trans-antagonistic violence) 

The DNC says, w/ proper clothes on, "If you, I was inspired to flee prep cook. . 
You know. . After perpetrated by anarchists in the matter, regardless of actual 
or junk, reprimands from my mammys, I dropped out of South”

Many more murders will be will’s work until November’s contexts.  We make our spaces do

“Ms Demaetry, We are guided by the new philosophy of mystic degree”  
as they participate in public with the capacity to lead down anti-matter,
mothers, parents, and Black trans folks have not changed. . 
 To live in the sacred 3rd, 2020. 

The interest on that requires mothers to work uplift, especially with disability, 
religious beliefs or disbeliefs, a mother strove to be vagabond, semi-alcholic,

At a ripe 18 the borrowed money will be women, and is free from payment no matter

Not sure with you. Intent the support

But gun Mailer stabbing Van Gogh

-conflagration gravel in the awakened. 

Hello- hi of being human if 
I am authored turnpike turned 40 years

You for the Crosby leaping into completion
not that coughing unwell on its mind;

Crooked reference, nostalgia rains the acts

Bench Chatterton drinking gutters
of his light dancing across 
elbow turning point pneumonia, reminder of boat 
into the medicine, the impossibility to get out

Impossibility of being old on Tuesday. A thief, fucker
